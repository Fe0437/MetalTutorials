# ü§ü MetalTutorials üé∏

Welcome to MetalTutorials, a step-by-step guide designed to assist you in creating your own Metal Renderer. The main objectives of these tutorials are:
- To maintain minimal code
- To introduce minimal additions in each tutorial
This approach helps the reader understand the changes as we progress in building the engine.

## Getting Started üèÅ

Clone this repository and open the project in Xcode.
Each tutorial is structured to build upon the last, starting with the fundamentals and gradually introducing more sophisticated rendering techniques.

Open the file `MTMetalTuorialsApp.swift` you will find :

```swift
@main
struct MetalTutorialsApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            // substitute here to choose the tutorial
            MT1ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

Each tutorial has its own ContentView, named MT[tutorial-number]ContentView. 
To test a specific tutorial, simply replace the number (e.g., MT1ContentView -> MT2ContentView).

Every tutorial is self-contained, allowing you to make modifications without affecting other tutorials.
